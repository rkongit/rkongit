AI Architect | Software Engineer

Building practical, production-grade intelligent systems. I focus on agentic AI, multimodal interfaces, enterprise integrations, and scalable automation pipelines. My work spans LLM orchestration, data engineering, and deploying AI systems that operate reliably in real-world environments.

Areas of interest include
• Agentic architectures
• Multilingual and speech-driven AI
• Enterprise data pipelines
• Full-stack automation using OpenAI, LangChain, and cloud-native tooling
• Distributed systems and high-performance backend engineering

Always exploring ways to convert complex workflows into robust autonomous systems. Open to collaboration on applied AI and infrastructure-heavy projects.
